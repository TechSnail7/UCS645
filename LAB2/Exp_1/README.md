## Experiment 1 — Execution Time Measurement (Vector Addition)

The program was executed with different thread counts using OpenMP.  
Below are the recorded execution times.

| Threads | Time (seconds) |
|---------|----------------|
| 1       | 0.231274       |
| 2       | 0.257766       |
| 4       | 0.137714       |
| 8       | 0.098938       |
| 16      | 0.076002       |
